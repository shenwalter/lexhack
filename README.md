## Inspiration
We decided to make a game with the language Processing, which we all had downloaded for the first time today.

## What it does
This game has astroids that move around, as well as a bot that tries to kill a good being. The good being must defend itself.

## How we built it
We used Processing to make our game! And Github, I guess.

## Challenges we ran into
We had a lot of bugs in Processing, especially because we were beginners.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We fixed the bugs! Also, we effectively learned a programming language in a day!

## What we learned
We learned that Processing is a pretty cool spinoff of Java.

## What's next for The Battle Room
We hope to add more features, as well as maybe embed it into HTML with p5.js.
